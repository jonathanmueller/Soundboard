# Soundboard App

This project is a [React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) that lets you play sounds on your PC from using a device on your network (like your mobile phone).

## Sounds
Sounds have to be places into the `sounds/` folder and will be displayed in the app as buttons.\
Currently, only `.mp3` and `.wav` files are supported.

## Configuration
If the app is launched from the local PC where it is running, the audio settings are displayed at the top.\
Also, you can show a QR code for easy access to the site with your phone.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
It also creates an executable that can be launched without having to have node installed.
